# `Introduction`

This npm package offers an integration solution for React applications requiring authentication through the B.C. government's Single Sign-On SSO ([CSS]) service. It abstracts the complexity of handling SSO protocols manually. By using this package, developers can quickly implement authentication and authorization in their React applications to meet B.C. government security standards.

- Built for a NodeJS:20 React app.
- For [CSS] Gold Standard with usecase set as `Browser Login and Service Account`.
- Works with Vanilla JavaScript or TypeScript 5. [![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-F7DF1E?logo=javascript&logoColor=000)](https://www.javascript.com/) [![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-3178C6?logo=typescript&logoColor=ffffff)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
